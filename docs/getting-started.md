# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with HyperApp is to grab the minified library from a CDN.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperapp"></script>
```

You can use a specific version too.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperapp@0.8.1"></script>
```

Or try it on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/jbucaran/pen/Qdwpxy?editors=0010).

## Hello World

Create an index.html file, paste the code below and open it in your browser. Or download it [here](https://rawgit.com/jbucaran/469c2e2aed3b9222bf6d307920741008/raw/8bd3ce171772808d240870374f343d7c278f9287/index.html).

```html
<body>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperapp"></script>
  <script>

  const { h, app } = hyperapp

  app({
    state: "Hi.",
    view: state => h("h1", null, state)
  })

  </script>
</body>
```

## How does it work?

The [h](/docs/api.md#h) function returns an object that represents a DOM element. This object is called a [virtual node](/docs/virtual-node.md).

```js
{
  tag: "h1",
  data: null,
  children: ["Hi"]
}
```

The [app](/docs/api.md#app) function renders the view and mounts it on the DOM.

## Hyperx/JSX

You may prefer [Hyperx](/docs/hyperx.md)/[JSX](/docs/jsx.md) to describe your views and compile them to h function calls using a [Build Pipeline](#build-pipeline).

If you are already using Hyperx, you can skip the compilation step at the expense of slightly inferior performance.

Here is the previous example rewritten in Hyperx.

```html
<body>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperapp"></script>
  <script src="https://wzrd.in/standalone/hyperx"></script>
  <script>

  const { h, app } = hyperapp
  const html = hyperx(h)

  app({
    state: "Hi.",
    view: state => html`<h1>${state}</h1>`
  })

  </script>
</body>
```

This workflow is fine for simple demos, but not the best for real world applications.

## Build Pipeline

To create applications ready for production you will be using:

[Browserify]: http://browserify.org/
[Rollup]: http://rollupjs.org/
[Webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/
[Babel]: http://babeljs.io/
[Bublé]: https://buble.surge.sh/guide/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[Yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com

* A **package manager**, e.g. [npm] or [Yarn]. It makes it easy to share and reuse third-party packages.
* A **compiler** e.g. [Babel] or [Bublé]. It transforms modern JavaScript into code compatible with older browsers.
* A **bundler**, e.g. [Webpack], [Rollup] or [Browserify]. It takes modules and their dependencies and generates a single bundle that can be delivered to the browser.

### Why?

To compile [Hyperx](/docs/hyperx.md) or [JSX](/docs/jsx.md) into native HyperApp [h](/docs/api.md#h) function calls.

The generated code is smaller and faster than the alternative: sending a parser down the wire and compiling the view in the user's browser.

Hyperx/JSX in:

```jsx
<main id="app">Hi.</main>
```

Vanilla out:
```jsx
h("main", { id: "app" }, "Hi.")
```
